## Python/R code demo

### QTL script
In `QTL/` demo folder, QTL mapping was done on HPC clusters (qtl_scan_16s.sub/.sh/.R) followed by downstream analysis and data vitalization in R (qtl_peak_16s.R)

### Metagenomic script
In `Metagenomic/` demo folder, I used python for assembly pipeline (assembly_pipeline.py) and run the job on HPC clusters (WGS_assembly.sub/.sh)
